Functioning of the application:

The professor will create a class and add tests to the class. 
A student will request to get added to the current list of created classes. 
The professor will then add or reject the student.
Once the student has been added to the class, the student can see and take the scheduled tests of that class.
After the student takes the test, the score will be calculated and will be accessible to both professor and the student.
